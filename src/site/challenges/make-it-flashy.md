title: Make It Flashy

### The challenge

Make something you have never made before that could be added to a web page.  If it's a canvas element game that is cool.  If it's something flashy like the racing stripes that's cool.  Just something that isn't a web page itself (you could add it to an existing page) and the flashier the better.  Also try to time box it to no more than an hour total time put into it.

### Suggestions

Get something working.  Make it flashier.  Make it more flashier.

### Rules

  1) You may NOT do something you have done before
  2) You can use any libraries or packages or other peoples code you want
  3) If using other's code, you need to change it enough to at least feel ownership of the concept/idea of what you have put together
