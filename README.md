# Team Dash Coding Challenges

This is a place for just-for-fun coding challenges for the team.

To get started you can run `npm i` then `npm start` but to get into the guts of stuff take a look into the `gulp-tasks`.

Changes to master are automatically deployed to a static site by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
